This study explores the application of super-resolution deep learning algorithms in reconstructing high-fidelity flow field data in fluid mechanics. Specifically, the effective- ness of SRCNN, VDSR, EDSR, and WDSR deep learning models in fluid flow datasets using objective metrics such as PSNR and MAE is evaluated.
